For the alpha-beta part, I am not sure when to change the value of Alpha/Beta, such as

-I set “if (value > alpha && value < beta)” to change the value of Alpha

	And this could be “if (value > alpha && value < beta)”

-I set “if (value < beta && value > alpha)” to change the value of Beta

	And this could be “if (value > alpha && value > alpha)”

So if I get a lot of wrong answers for alpha-beta test, it may be caused by this. Please consider this situation.

Thank you!
