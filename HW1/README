1. If there is no path available, this code will print the log at first line, and "NoPathAvailable" at the second line, then follow by a 0 at the third line.

(Log)
NoPathAvailable
0

2. When some child has a better cost than previously visited, I enqueue this child again and revisit it. And finally I output full expansion log which may occur two or more same nodes in the log sequence.

eg. In some DFS result:

ae-ab-aa-ad-ac-ad-af
ae-af
5

I output ad twice because ad has been enqueued twice.
